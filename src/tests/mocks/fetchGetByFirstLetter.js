    instruction: `Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Drain and rinse the soaked wheat,
     put it in a medium pan with lots of water, bring to a boil and simmer for an hour,
     until cooked. Drain and set aside.\r\n\r\nSeason the lamb with a teaspoon of salt and
     some black pepper. Put one tablespoon of oil in a large, deep sauté pan for which you
     have a lid; place on a medium-high heat. Add some of the lamb – don't overcrowd the
     pan – and sear for four minutes on all sides. Transfer to a bowl, and repeat with the
     remaining lamb, adding oil as needed.\r\n\r\nLower the heat to medium and add a
     tablespoonof oil to the pan. Add the shallots and fry for four minutes, until
     caramelised. Tip these into the lamb bowl, and repeat with the remaining vegetables
     until they are all nice and brown, adding more oil as you need it.\r\n\r\nOnce all
     the vegetables are seared and removed from the pan, add the wine along with the
     sugar, herbs, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Boil on a high
     heat for about three minutes.\r\n\r\nTip the lamb, vegetables and whole wheat back
     into the pot, and add the stock. Cover and boil for five minutes, then transfer to
     the oven for an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nRemove the stew from the oven and check the
     liquid; if there is a lot, remove the lid and boil for a few minutes.`,
